# Face Recognition and Anti-Spoofing for Biometric Applications  
### B.Tech Final Year Project

This repository contains the implementation of a **Face Recognition and Anti-Spoofing System** designed for secure biometric authentication.  
The system integrates **face recognition** with **liveness (anti-spoofing) detection** to prevent presentation attacks such as printed photos, mobile screen replays, and video attacks.

This work is supported by a **self-made dataset** and has been **published as a research paper**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Biometric systems based on facial recognition are widely used in access control, attendance systems, and identity verification.  
However, traditional face recognition systems are vulnerable to **spoofing attacks** such as:

- Printed photographs  
- Mobile/laptop screen replays  
- Video-based attacks  

This project addresses these challenges by combining:
- **Face Recognition** for identity verification  
- **Anti-Spoofing Detection** to ensure the presence of a live human subject  

Authentication is granted **only when both modules succeed**, making the system robust and secure.

## 🔍 System Workflow

1. Capture face input using webcam  
2. Detect and preprocess face region  
3. Perform face recognition  
4. Apply anti-spoofing (liveness detection)  
5. Authenticate user only if both checks pass
